      "title": "Absence of Pressure-Driven Supersolid Flow at Low Frequency",
      "abstract": "An important unresolved question in supersolid research is the degree to\nwhich the non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) phenomenon observed in the\ntorsional oscillator experiments of Kim and Chan, is evidence for a\nBose-condensed supersolid state with superfluid-like properties. In an open\nannular geometry, Kim and Chan found that a fraction of the solid moment of\ninertia is decoupled from the motion of the oscillator; however, when the\nannulus is blocked by a partition, the decoupled supersolid fraction is locked\nto the oscillator being accelerated by an AC pressure gradient generated by the\nmoving partition. These observations are in accord with superfluid\nhydrodynamics. We apply a low frequency AC pressure gradient in order to search\nfor a superfluid-like response in a supersolid sample. Our results are\nconsistent with zero supersolid flow in response to the imposed low frequency\npressure gradient. A statistical analysis of our data sets a bound, at the 68%\nconfidence level, of 9.6$\\times 10^{-4}$ nm/s for the mass transport velocity\ncarried by a possible supersolid flow. In terms of a simple model for the\nsupersolid, an upper bound of 3.3$\\times 10^{-6}$ is set for the supersolid\nfraction at 25 mK, at this same confidence level. These findings force the\nconclusion that the NCRI observed in the torsional oscillator experiments is\nnot evidence for a frequency independent superfluid-like state. Supersolid\nbehavior is a frequency-dependent phenomenon, clearly evident in the frequency\nrange of the torsional oscillator experiments, but undetectably small at\nfrequencies approaching zero.",

      "abstract": "Assuming that the well-confirmed non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI)\neffect in solid $^4$He, suggested by Leggett, indicates supersolid behavior, we\nmake a number of remarks about both theory and experiment. (1) The\nlong-wavelength, low-frequency (\"hydrodynamic\") part of the theory of Andreev\nand Lifshitz has nine variables, and thus must have nine modes. We find a new\nmode associated with lattice point diffusion (and thus vacancy diffusion); it\nmay explain the absence of supersolid behavior in low-frequency pressure-driven\nflow. (2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,\nin disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper\nlimit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this\nmay not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second\npropagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to\nthe long relaxation times $\\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies\nsatisfying $\\omega\\tau\\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore\nthe absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply\nthe absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied\nlattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should\ninteract with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus\ndislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by\nrotation. We discuss some experimental implications for the vortex liquid\nmodel, shear response, hysteresis, and relaxation.",

      "abstract": "A supersolid is a counter-intuitive state of matter that combines the\nfrictionless flow of a superfluid with the crystal-like periodic density\nmodulation of a solid. Since the first prediction in the 1950s, experimental\nefforts to realize this state have focussed mainly on Helium, where\nsupersolidity remains elusive. Recently, supersolidity has also been studied\nintensively in ultracold quantum gases, and some of its defining properties\nhave been induced in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and\nBECs coupled to two crossed optical cavities. However, the periodicity of the\ncrystals in both systems is fixed to the wavelength of the applied periodic\noptical potentials. Recently, hallmark properties of a supersolid -- the\nperiodic density modulation and simultaneous global phase coherence -- have\nbeen observed in arrays of dipolar quantum droplets, where the crystallization\nhappens in a self-organized manner due to intrinsic interactions. In this\nletter, we prove the genuine supersolid nature of these droplet arrays by\ndirectly observing the low-energy Goldstone mode. The dynamics of this mode is\nreminiscent of the effect of second sound in other superfluid systems and\nfeatures an out-ofphase oscillation of the crystal array and the superfluid\ndensity. This mode exists only due to the phase rigidity of the experimentally\nrealized state, and therefore confirms the genuine superfluidity of the\nsupersolid.",

Using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics we derive the\nmacroscopic dynamical equations for this system.

The normal modes for such a system have a crossover in frequency,\nabove which the normal fluid velocity $v_{ni}$ is an independent variable and\nbelow which it is locked to $v_{Li}$. For an isotropic lattice we study both\nthe transverse response and longitudinal response. The ring geometry for atomic\ngas supersolid states may provide a geometry for testing these predictions.",

      "title": "The Influence Of Elastic Deformations On The Supersolid Transition",
      "abstract": "We study, within the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of phase transitions, how\nelastic deformations in a supersolid lead to local changes in the supersolid\ntransition temperature. The GL theory is mapped onto a Schrodinger-type\nequation with an effective potential that depends on local dilatory strain. The\neffective potential is attractive for local contractions and repulsive for\nlocal expansion. Different types of elastic deformations are studied. We find\nthat a contraction (expansion) of the medium that may be brought about by,\ne.g., applied stress leads to a higher (lower) transition temperature as\ncompared to the unstrained medium. In addition, we investigate edge\ndislocations and illustrate that the local transition temperature may be\nincreased in the immediate vicinity of the dislocation core. Our analysis is\nnot limited to supersolidity. Similar strain effects should also play a role in\nsuperconductors.",

      "abstract": "Superfluidity, liquid flow without friction, is familiar in helium. The first\nevidence for \"supersolidity\", its analogue in quantum solids, came from recent\ntorsional oscillator (TO) measurements involving 4-He. At temperatures below\n200 mK, TO frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled\nfrom the oscillator. This behavior has been replicated by several groups but\nsolid 4-He does not respond to pressure differences and persistent currents and\nother signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory\nindicate that defects are involved. These should also affect the solid's\nmechanical behavior and so we have measured the shear modulus of solid 4-He at\nlow frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the\nsame dependence on measurement amplitude, 3-He impurity concentration and\nannealing as the decoupling seen in TO experiments. This unusual elastic\nbehavior is explained in terms of a dislocation network which is pinned by 3-He\nat the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency\nchanges in TO experiments appear to be related to the motion of these\ndislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state.",

      "abstract": "Water is ubiquitously important but least known. This perspective features\nthe latest finding of two exotic forms of water called quasisolid and\nsupersolid phases due to the cooperativity and disparity of the O:H-O bond in\nits segmental length, energy, and specific heat when subjected to thermal,\nelectric, and undercoordination perturbation. The quasisolid (QS) phase only\nappears at temperatures between melting and ice nucleation, regardless of\nsample size, and this phase has a negative thermal expansivity (NTE). However,\npolarization or molecular undercoordination creates the supersolid phase in\nskins of water and ice, droplets, ionic hydration cells, and volumetric water\nwith a current flow or under a 106 eV/cm electric bias. This phase is\ncharacterized by ~10% H-O bond contraction and vibrating at ~3450 cm-1. The\nsupersolid has unique properties such as high elasticity, mechanical strength,\noptical reflectivity, structure order, thermal stability, diffusivity,\ncatalytic activity, and chemical reactivity. Liquid-QS-Ice transition with QS\nphase energy absorption occurs for water due to H-O bond contraction during\nthermal decay but not for the supersolid phase of saturated NaCl solution. The\nNTE of the QS fosters ice buoyancy and the supersolidity endows ice\nslipperiness, supercooling, superheating, premelting, low-temperature fiber\nelasticity, water bridge, and warm water fast cooling, as well as on water\nchemistry.",

      "abstract": "For nearly half a century the supersolid phase of matter has remained\nmysterious, not only eluding experimental observation, but also generating a\ngreat deal of controversy among theorists. Recent discovery of what is\ninterpreted as a non-classical moment of inertia at low temperature in solid\nHe-4 has elicited much excitement as a possible first observation of a\nsupersolid phase. In the two years following the discovery, however, more\npuzzles than answers have been provided to the fundamental issue of whether the\nsupersolid phase exists, in helium or any other naturally occurring condensed\nmatter system. Presently, there is no established theoretical framework to\nunderstand the body of experimental data on He-4. Different microscopic\nmechanisms that have been suggested to underlie superfluidity in a perfect\nquantum crystal do not seem viable for \\he4, for which a wealth of experimental\nand theoretical evidence points to an insulating crystalline ground state. This\nperspective addresses some of the outstanding problems with the interpretation\nof recent experimental observations of the apparent superfluid response in He-4\n(seen now by several groups) and discusses various scenarios alternative to the\nhomogeneous supersolid phase, such as superfluidity induced by extended defects\nof the crystalline structure which include grain boundaries, dislocations,\nanisotropic stresses, etc. Can a metastable superfluid \"glassy\" phase exist,\nand can it be relevant to some of the experimental observations ? One of the\nmost interesting and unsolved fundamental questions is what interatomic\npotentials, given the freedom to design one, can support an ideal supersolid\nphase in continuous space, and can they be found in Nature.",

Since this \"first observation\", other\nexperimental groups have observed such effects in the response to the rotation\nof samples of crystalline helium, and it has become clear that the response of\nthe solid is extremely sensitive to growth conditions, annealing processes, and\n3He impurities. A peak in the specific heat in the same range of temperatures\nhas been reported as well as anomalies in the elastic behaviour of solid 4He\nwith a strong resemblance to the phenomena revealed by torsional oscillator\nexperiments. Very recently, the observation of unusual mass transport in hcp\nsolid 4He has also been reported, suggesting superflow. From the theoretical\npoint of view, powerful simulation methods have been used to study solid 4He,\nbut the interpretation of the data is still rather difficult; dealing with the\nquestion of supersolidity means that one has to face not only the problem of\nthe coexistence of quantum coherence phenomena and crystalline order, exploring\nthe realm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum field theory, but also\nthe problem of the role of disorder, i.e., how defects, such as vacancies,\nimpurities, dislocations, and grain boundaries, participate in the phase\ntransition mechanism.",

In an attempt to separate\ndynamic elastic effects from a true supersolid signal, we employed a torsional\noscillator with two eigen frequencies to study the $^4$He-Vycor system. We\nfound that frequency dependent elastic signals can entirely account for the\nobserved period shift signals. Although, we conclude that supersolid does not\nexist for the $^4$He-Vycor case, the question of its presence in bulk samples\nremains open. In our current experiments we apply the two-frequency test to\nbulk samples of solid $^4$He. Again we find a frequency dependent contribution\narising from elastic effects, however, in some cases we also find a small\nfrequency independent contribution, which may indicate the existence of a\nremnant supersolid phase.

      "abstract": "The existence of a paradoxical supersolid phase of matter, possessing the\napparently incompatible properties of crystalline order and superfluidity, was\npredicted 50 years ago. Solid helium was the natural candidate, but there\nsupersolidity has not been observed yet, despite numerous attempts. Ultracold\nquantum gases have recently shown the appearance of the periodic order typical\nof a crystal, due to various types of controllable interactions. A crucial\nfeature of a D-dimensional supersolid is the occurrence of up to D+1 gapless\nexcitations reflecting the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous\nbreaking of two continuous symmetries: the breaking of phase invariance,\ncorresponding to the locking of the phase of the atomic wave functions at the\norigin of superfluid phenomena, and the breaking of translational invariance\ndue to the lattice structure of the system. The occurrence of such modes has\nbeen the object of intense theoretical investigations, but their experimental\nobservation is still missing. Here we demonstrate the supersolid symmetry\nbreaking through the appearance of two distinct compressional oscillation modes\nin a harmonically trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, reflecting the\ngapless Goldstone excitations of the homogeneous system. We observe that the\ntwo modes have different natures, with the higher frequency mode associated\nwith an oscillation of the periodicity of the emergent lattice and the lower\none characterizing the superfluid oscillations. Our work paves the way to\nexplore the two quantum phase transitions between the superfluid, supersolid\nand solid-like configurations that can be accessed by tuning a single\ninteraction parameter.",

      "abstract": "The concept of a supersolid state is paradoxical. It combines the\ncrystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it\nis built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous\nsymmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous\ntranslational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50\nyears ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A\nvariant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed\nlattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice\nsupersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that\ncharacterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the\nrealization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking.\nThe continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically\ncoupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase\ncoherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by\nmeasuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields\nleaking from the cavities. These light fields are also used to monitor the\nposition fluctuations in real-time. Our concept provides a route to creating\nand studying glassy many-body systems with contrallably lifted ground-state\ndegeneracies, such as supersolids in the presence of disorder.",

      "abstract": "Simple scalings suggest that super-Earths are more likely than an equivalent\nEarth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and\nthermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity\ndecreases, resulting in lower convective vigor in the deep mantle. According to\nconventional thinking, this might result in no convection in a super-Earth's\ndeep mantle. Here we evaluate this. First, we here extend the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of\nto a pressure of 1 TPa. The activation volume for diffusion creep becomes very\nlow at very high pressure, but nevertheless for the largest super-Earths the\nviscosity along an adiabat may approach 1030 Pa s in the deep mantle. Second,\nwe use these calculated values in numerical simulations of mantle convection\nand lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models\nassume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties\nand plastic yielding induced plate tectonics. Results confirm the likelihood of\nplate tectonics and show a novel self-regulation of deep mantle temperature.\nThe deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead internal heating raises the\ntemperature until the viscosity is low enough to facilitate convective loss of\nthe radiogenic heat, which results in a super-adiabatic temperature profile and\na viscosity increase with depth of no more than ~3 orders of magnitude,\nregardless of the viscosity increase that is calculated for an adiabat.\nConvection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings and\nsmall, time-dependent downwellings. If a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten\nafter its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its\ndeep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a\n\"super basal magma ocean\" - a larger version of (Labrosse et al., 2007).",

This theory includes an internal pressure $P$, distinct from\nthe applied pressure $P_a$ and the stress tensor $\\lambda_{ik}$. Under uniform\nstatic $P_{a}$, we have $\\lambda_{ik} = (P-P_{a})\\delta_{ik}$. For $P_{a} \\ne\n0$, Maxwell relations imply that $P \\sim P_{a}^{2}$. The theory also permits\nvacancy diffusion but treats vacancies as conserved. It gives three sets of\npropagating elastic modes; it also gives two diffusive modes, one largely of\nentropy density and one largely of vacancy density (or, more generally, defect\ndensity). For the vacancy diffusion mode (or, equivalently, the lattice\ndiffusion mode) the vacancies behave like a fluid within the solid, with the\ndeviations of internal pressure associated with density changes nearly\ncanceling the deviations of stress associated with strain. We briefly consider\npressurization experiments in solid $^4$He at low temperatures in light of this\nlattice diffusion mode, which for small $P_{a}$ has diffusion constant $D_{L}\n\\sim P_{a}^{2}$. The general principles of the theory -- that both volume and\nstrain should be included as thermodynamic variables, with the result that both\n$P$ and $\\lambda_{ik}$ appear -- should apply to all solids under pressure,\nespecially near the solid-liquid transition. The lattice diffusion mode\nprovides an additional degree of freedom that may permit surfaces with\ndifferent surface treatments to generate different responses in the bulk.",

      "title": "Convective inhibition with an atmosphere, I: super-critical cores on\n  sub-Neptune/super-Earths",
      "abstract": "In this work we generalize the notion of convective inhibition to apply in\ncases where there is an infinite reservoir of condensible species (i.e., an\nocean). We propose a new model for the internal structure and thermal evolution\nof super-Earths with hydrogen envelopes. We derive the criterion for convective\ninhibition in a generalizes phase mixture from first principles thermodynamics.\nWe then investigate the global ocean case using a water-hydrogen system, for\nwhich we have data, as an example. We then extend our arguments to apply to a\nsystem of hydrogen and silicate vapor. We then employ a simple atmospheric\nmodel to apply our findings to super-Earths and to make predictions about their\ninternal structures and thermal evolution. For hydrogen envelope masses roughly\nin the range between 0.1-10% Earth's mass, convective contact between the\nenvelope and core may shut down because of the compositional gradient that\narises from silicate partial vaporization. For envelope hydrogen masses that\ncause the associated basal pressure to exceed the critical pressure of pure\nsilicate (of order a couple kilobars), the base of that envelope and top of the\ncore lie on the critical line of the two-phase hydrogen-silicate phase diagram.\nThe corresponding temperature is much higher than convective models would\nsuggest. The core then cools inefficiently, with intrinsic heat fluxes\npotentially comparable to the Earth's internal heat flux today. This low heat\nflux may allow the core to remain in a high entropy supercritical state for\nbillions of years, but the details of this depend on the nature of the\ntwo-component phase diagram at high pressure, something that is currently\nunknown. A supercritical core thermodynamically permits the dissolution of\nlarge quantities of hydrogen into the core.",

In particular, the Parachutejump scheme sought to lessen the\nexcitation produced when crossing the phase transition, and the Bang-Bang\nmethod sought to shorten the formation time.

Recently, it has been\nproposed that nonlinear periodic modulations known as cnoidal waves, that\nnaturally emerge in Bose-Einstein condensates, provide a promising platform to\nfind and study supersolidity in nonequilibrium phases of matter. Nevertheless,\nso far the analysis has been limited to a one-dimensional zero-temperature\nsystem. By combining the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a finite\ntemperature holographic model, we show that the proposed cnoidal wave\nsupersolid phases of matter are always energetically and dynamically unstable\nat finite temperature. We ascribe this instability to the dynamics of the\n\"elastic\" Goldstone mode arising as a direct consequence of translational\norder. Finally, we study the dynamical instability of the supersolid state and\nconnect it to the production of topological defects during the relaxation\ntowards a final homogeneous equilibrium state with smaller superflow current,\nsimilar to the Landau instability dynamics in superfluids. Our results suggest\nthat the supersolidity of cnoidal waves can emerge only as a transient\nphenomenon and not as a truly equilibrium and stable ground state.",
